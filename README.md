# Q4-Capstone-Dev-Talk


# Overview
As junior developers just finishing up our 1 year stint in a coding bootcamp, we understand the struggles and importance of finding a safe and helpful community
to rely on in times of need. We understand that everyone learns at their own pace and some will need more help than others. No matter your level of experience,
we all struggle and need a helping hand to pick us up when we fall.

We have designed Dev-Talk an instagram like social media platform for developers.
Here you can create a new account and become part of a helpful community of developers willing to aid those in need.


# What you can do
users can easily sign up for new accounts and login
once logged in, users have the ability to create a profile
they can add a bio, location, links to their github, linkedin, or portfolio website and even an avatar image.
the profile can be updated at any time.

Users can search for other users to follow.
after following another user, that users posts will appear on the session users home feed.

Users have the ability to create personal posts that will be displayed on their home feed and profile.
They can also ask for help in the Community tab.

users have the ability to like and comment on all posts
also a user who is the author of a post can delete all comments on their posts
and comment authors can delete their own comments.
